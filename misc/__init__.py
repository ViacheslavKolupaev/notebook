"""The `__init__.py` file of the regular Python package.

A regular package is typically implemented as a directory containing an __init__.py file.

When a regular package is imported, this __init__.py file is implicitly executed, and the
objects it defines are bound to names in the packageâ€™s namespace.

Docs: https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html#regular-packages

# This will be run when the module is imported:
print('\nModule imports before the start of the main function...')
print(f'1. package: {__package__} | name: {__name__} | file: {__file__}')
